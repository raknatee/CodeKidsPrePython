```
#### Naming Dos and Don'ts
- Start with a letter
- Symbols and spaces are not allowed (-, /, #, @) 
- The underscore can be used (For example, first_name, last_name)
### Integers and Floats

#### Assignment
```python
interger1 = 5
float1 = 0.5
```
#### Calculation
```python
x = 50
y = x * 5
print(y)
```
Try to change a value!
```python
x = 100
y = x + 5
print(y)
```

### Strings

#### Assignment
```python
my_name = "Ally Alien"
print(my_name)
```

####  Combination
```python
first_name = "Ally"
last_name = "Alien"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
```
```python
first_name = "Ally"
last_name = "Alien"
print(first_name + last_name)
```
#### length of a string

```python
my_name = "Ally Alien"
print(len(my_name)) # 10
```

### Comment
```python
# print("Hello 1")
# print("Hello 2")
