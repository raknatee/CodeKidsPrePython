## Lesson Learns

### What is the list?

When you want to store a lot of data, or perhaps the order of the data is important, you may need to use a list. A list can hold many items together and keep them in order. Python gives each item a number that shows its position in the list. You can change the items in the list at any time.

#### Not a good example
```python
my_friend_0 = "James"
my_friend_1 = "David"
my_friend_2 = "Anthony"
my_friend_3 = "Larry"
```
#### Using List
```python
friends = ["James", "David", "Anthony", "Larry"]
```
#### Getting a item from a list
```python
friends = ["James", "David", "Anthony", "Larry"]
print(len(friends)) # 4
print(friends[0])   # James
print(friends[1])   # David
print(friends[2])   # Anthony
print(friends[3])   # Larry
```

### Boolean, Logic and Condition

#### Boolean
There are only True or False values for a boolean value.
```python
bool1 = True
print(bool1)
bool2 = False
print(bool2)
```

#### Logical operators

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --|---|
| == | equal
|!=| not equal
|<| less than
|>| greater than
|<=| less than or equal
|>= | greater than or equal



#### Pineapples and Zebras


<div align="center">
<img  :src="$withBase('/pz.png')">
</div>

```python
n_pineapples = 5
n_zebras     = 2

answer1 = n_pineapples > 5
answer2 = n_zebras < n_pineapples 
answer3 = n_zebras >= 1
answer4 = n_pineapples > 20

print(answer1)
print(answer2)
print(answer3)
print(answer4)
```

#### Condition
```python
n_pineapples = 5
n_zebras     = 2
if( n_pineapples > n_zebras):
	print("We have enough food to feed the zebras")
```
```python
n_pineapples = 2
n_zebras     = 5
if( n_pineapples > n_zebras):
	print("We have enough food to feed the zebras")
```
```python
n_pineapples = 2
n_zebras     = 5
if( n_pineapples > n_zebras):
	print("We have enough food to feed the zebras")
else:
	print("Noooo, we need more pineapples")
```
